## Running Docker on IoT Edge Platform

Popular IoT Edge devices like Raspberry Pi and  Jetson Nano are now plenty powerful to run a regular Linux distro, have a Docker engine installed, and run your containers without much overhead. Undoubtedly, most of the devices out there are more powerful than the small VMs provided by major cloud services. IoT applications target a wide variety of device platforms. During prototyping and early phases of development, IoT projects are often developed using generic microcontroller-based development boards or single-board computers (SBCs) like the Raspberry Pi. Running Docker on IoT devices offers advantages by bringing containers to the edge. 

Here's a curated list of developer tools and tutorials that shows how containers help in accelerating apps on the IoT Edge devices:
